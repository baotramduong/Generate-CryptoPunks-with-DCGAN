## Introduction

An NFT is a Non Fungible Token, unique tokens that can be traded and exchanged on the Ethereum blockchain.

CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique collectible characters, each is a 24x24 pixel, 8-bit-style unique avatar, with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Their creation began as an experiment, conducted by software developers Matt Hall and John Watkinson in 2017. The Cryptopunks were the inspiration for the ERC-721 standard that powers most digital art and collectibles today.

CryptoPunks is NFT series to catch popular interest and one of the most actively traded. As of October 2021, the market capitalization of all 10,000 CryptoPunks is estimated at around 1,600,00 ETH, or over $5B USD.

In this project, we will use DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) and train it on the CryptoPunks dataset to generate new punks. GAN belongs to a group of unsupervised learning technique called Generative Models. Generative Models are a type of machine learning models that are used to describe phenomena in data and enables computers to understand the real world. Generative Models and GANs have been ones of the most successful developments in the recent years in Computer Vision.

## Data Source

The dataset [CryptoPunks, can be found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/cryptopunks), consists of:

* All CryptoPunk transactions since 2017.
* PNG images of the 10,000 Punks, each example is a 24x24 color scale image for a total of 576 pixels in total.
* The dataset only contains type and accessories information for each CryptoPunk.
